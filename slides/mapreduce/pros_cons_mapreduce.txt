Pros and Cons of MapReduce

Pros:
     1. Scalable (due to simple design)
     2. Runs on cheap commodity hardware
     3. Procedural control (we can control of the execution of every step)
     4. Handles fault tolerance by data replication in worker nodes

Cons:
     1. It is not flexible i.e. the MapReduce framework is rigid
     2. It does not take advantage of memory/RAM (mostly uses disk I/O)
     3. There is the only possible flow of execution: map() followed by reduce()
     4. Explicit filtering is not easy (you have to implement filters by mappers and/or reducers)
