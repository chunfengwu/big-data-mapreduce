What is Amazon Athena?
======================
Amazon Athena is an analytics 
and interactive query service 
that use interactive standard 
SQL to analyze data stored on 
Simple Storage Service (S3).

What kind of service is that?
=============================
It is a serverless service i.e. 
there is no need to setup the 
instances for the datastore and 
manage the infrastructure. 

How do we analyze data?
=======================
Also, there is no need to load 
data to Athena or run complex 
ETL processes. All you need to 
do is to point the data from the 
application to AWS S3. You can 
also simply store the logs on S3 
to analyze with them with SQL 
queries.


What Kind of Data 
Amazon Athena Analyzes?
=======================
Amazon Athena is capable of 
analyzing and processing  the  
structured  data  sets in 
the form of tables, semi-structured 
and unstructured data in any format. 

Data Format
===========
There are various formats like CSV, 
JSON, columnar data formats such as 
Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. 


Report Generation
=================
You can also use Amazon Athena to 
generate reports or to explore data 
with business intelligence tools or 
SQL clients, connected via a JDBC driver.


Back-End Structure 
of Amazon Athena
==================
Amazon Athena uses a distributed SQL 
engine to run the queries called Presto. 

It uses  Apache Hive  to  store the 
structured data. Apache Hive is a data 
warehouse tool that creates, drops and 
alters tables and partitions in the 
datasets.

Query Editor
============
Amazon Athena provides its query editor 
that help developers to create a query 
on the data, which is written on Apache 
Hive. These queries are compliant DDL 
Create Table statements or DDL drafted 
in Apache Hive, which facilitates reading, 
writing, and managing large and distributed 
data sets. Apache Hive supports various 
SQL functions and provides data partitioning 
similar to the concept of external tables. 

Athena metadata store is a repository 
that stores metadata such as column 
names and table definitions. It also 
supports various window functions, 
complex joins, and nested queries; and 
uses an approach known as schema-on-read, 
which allows developers to project their 
schema on the data at the same time when 
the query is executed.


Athena use compute resources or pools 
from multiple AZs (availability zones) 
to accelerate the performance of a query. 
Also, it allows developers to run queries 
in parallell on massive data size which 
may be in Terabytes or Petabytes.)

Pricing of Amazon Athena
=========================
Amazon Athena is a pay-as-you-go 
service, which is charged based on 
the number of queries executed. Since 
the data is stored on AWS S3, the charges 
are $5 per TB of scanned data from Amazon 
S3. 

Meta Data
=========
Athena does not charge anything on the 
failed queries. DDL Statements like 
   * CREATE, 
   * ALTER, 
   * DROP and 
   * partitioning queries 
   
are totally free. 

If you cancel a query, you will be charged 
only for the scanned data up to that point. 
Of course, you can reduce costs by using 
columnar formats, compression, and partitions. 
With all such techniques, Athena scans fewer 
data from Amazon S3.

It is simple to calculate the charges for 
AWS Athena as it is based on the amount of 
data that needs to be analyzed. It improves 
the performance of the query and helps 
organizations to save cost by converting 
the data to the columnar formats by using 
open-source tools such as Apache Parquet 
and Apache ORC.
